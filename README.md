Here's a `README.md` for your Streamlit-based Account Manager app:

# 🔐 Streamlit Account Manager

A lightweight, secure, and user-friendly account management tool built with Streamlit. It helps you store, edit, organize, and manage email and password credentials grouped by category. Clipboard support allows for quick copying of login details.

## 🚀 Features

* 📁 Grouped account storage
* 📋 Copy email and password to clipboard
* 📝 Edit and update existing account details
* ➕ Add new accounts
* 🔄 Move accounts between groups
* 🗑️ Delete accounts
* 💾 CSV-based persistence (`accounts.csv`)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/account-manager.git
   cd account-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas pyperclip
   ```

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📂 CSV Format

The app uses a CSV file (`accounts.csv`) to persist data. It must follow this structure:

| Group  | Email                                         | Password | Note                     |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Google | [example@gmail.com](mailto:example@gmail.com) | yourpass | This is my main account. |

The app will generate the CSV automatically if it doesn't exist.

## ⚠️ Notes

* **Clipboard functionality** requires `pyperclip`, which works out of the box on Windows/macOS. On Linux, you may need `xclip` or `xsel` installed:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install xclip  # or xsel
  ```

* Default password for new accounts: `Shabab28jan` (can be changed while adding).
